<Bio>


<p>
  I am Brais, a <span>front-end</span> web developer from Spain.
</p>

<p>
  I studied a couple of years of the bachelor’s degree in <span>Computer Science</span> but
  abandoned it after discovering that my passion was <span>web development</span> and college was
  too broad of a knowledge base and also pretty outdated, I didn’t like the learning path, still it
  was useful to gain a pretty good programming base as I touched C, C++, Java and learned about{' '}
  <span>design patterns</span>.
</p>

<p>
  After dropping school I decided to commit myself to learn web development <span>on my own</span>.
  starting my learning path with <span>CSS</span>, lately I have been fully focused on{' '}
  <span>Javascript</span> and its ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
  Since then I took a good number of <span>online courses</span>, mainly at Udemy (Advanced CSS and
  Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!, The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real
  Projects! and Modern React with Redux) and some from Wes Bos (CSS Grid, Javascript30 and ES6).
</p>

<p>
  I also read <span>books</span> like Eloquent Javascript and YDKJS and like to listen to dev{' '}
  <span>podcasts</span> like Syntax.fm, React Podcast, Javascript Jabber, JS Party or Full Stack
  Radio and to read some <span>blogs</span> like the one from Kent C. Dodds or Dan Abramov’s.
</p>

<p>
  Everytime I learnt something new, I made a <span>project</span> in order to practice the knowledge
  that I just acquired.
