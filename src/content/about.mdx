<p>
  I am Brais, a <span>front-end</span> web developer from Spain.
</p>

<p>
  After working for several years as a photographer's assistant and photo editor in the family business, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in <span>Computer Science</span>. However, I later left the program after realizing that my true passion lay in <span>web development</span>. I found the curriculum to be too broad and somewhat outdated, and I wasn't aligned with its learning path. That said, the experience was still valuable, as it provided me with a strong foundation in programming. During my time in the program, I gained experience with languages like C, C++, and Java, and I also learned about <span>design patterns</span> and databases.
</p>

<p>
  After that I committed myself to learn web development <span>on my own</span>, starting my journey
  with <span>CSS</span>, after that i focused on <span>Javascript</span> and its
  ecosystem, mostly <span>React</span> and all that surrounds it.
</p>

<p>
  My path continued taking good number of <span>online courses</span>, mainly at Udemy (Advanced CSS and
  Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!, The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real
  Projects! and Modern React with Redux) and some from Wes Bos (CSS Grid, Javascript30 and ES6).
</p>

<p>
  I have also read <span>books</span> like Eloquent Javascript and YDKJS along with listening to dev{' '}
  <span>podcasts</span> like Syntax.fm, React Podcast, Javascript Jabber, JS Party or Full Stack
  Radio and reading <span>blogs</span> like the ones from Kent C. Dodds or Dan Abramov. I like to
  watch conferences from around the world as well.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, I've worked primarily for two companies. The first was a local <span>fintech startup</span> called Coinscrap, where I gained my first real experience working with React. I worked there for a year and a half before joining <span>Xing</span>.

  At <span>Xing</span>, I experienced the most significant growth in my career, working with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL on a product used by <span>millions of users monthly</span>. I had the opportunity to learn from some incredible engineers.

  I was responsible for the frontend of the notification center and the network page. After demonstrating my skills, I was promoted to <span>Senior Frontend Engineer</span>, which is my current role.
