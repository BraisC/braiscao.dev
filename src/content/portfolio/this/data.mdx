    Yep, this very website you are looking right now also served a purpose on my learning path, in
    this case I used it to learn <span>Gatsby</span>, keep practicing <span>React</span> with{' '}
    <span>Styled Components</span> and <span>Framer Motion</span> as animation library.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a <span>SSG</span> website that reads data from <span>MDX</span> files at build time using{' '}
    <span>GraphQL</span> thanks to Gatsby data layer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website is hosted on <span>Netlify</span> implementing <span>continuous deployment</span>{' '}
    (CD) through the Github repo.
