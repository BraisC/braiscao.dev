  <p>
    One of my first web development projects, developed in <span>2018</span> for the fashion
    designer Maria Ada, this website uses <span>Wordpress</span> as a CMS with a <span>custom</span>{' '}
    designed and developed theme, meaning that there was no preexisting theme as I built it starting
    from a clean slate.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project I mainly wanted to practice <span>CSS Flexbox</span> using <span>SASS</span> and
    UI design but ended also working a lot with <span>PHP</span>.
