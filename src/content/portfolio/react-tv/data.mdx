  <p>
    A project fully designed and coded by me from scratch in order to practice my <span>React</span>{' '} knowledge. Completely made using just{' '}
    <span>hooks</span> and the new <span>context API</span>. Also used <span>CSS Grid</span> for first time, loved it!
  </p>
  <p>
    I used <span>React Router</span> for the routing of the app, <span>Styled Components</span> as{' '}
    <span>CSS-in-JS</span> tool for styling and <span>Framer Motion</span> as animation library to
    write custom animations and transitions.
