  <p>
    Project made from scratch in order to practice the latest things I learnt about{' '}
    <span>JavaScript</span>, mainly <span>ES6</span> and also to practice some <span>CSS</span>{' '}
    using <span>SASS</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It uses <span>Axios</span> to make requests to the official Marvel <span>REST API</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is made following the <span>MVC</span> arquitectural pattern and using{' '}
    <span>Webpack</span> as building tool. All views are generated using just Javascript.
